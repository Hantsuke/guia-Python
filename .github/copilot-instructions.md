# Copilot Instructions for guia-Py

## Project Overview
This repository is a practical Python guide, structured for progressive learning from basic to advanced topics. It is organized into clear, self-contained Jupyter notebooks with explanations, examples, and exercises.

## Directory Structure & Conventions
- **Each topic is a folder** under `basico/`, named with a prefix for ordering (e.g., `01.Comentario_print_e_Operadores`).
- **Lessons are Jupyter notebooks** (`.ipynb`) with stepwise progression: explanation, code, and exercises.
- **Naming:** Notebooks and folders use numbers and descriptive names for clarity and order.
- **Exercises and Challenges:** Each topic ends with `Exercicio.ipynb` and/or `Desafio.ipynb` for practice.

## Key Patterns
- **No external dependencies** are required for most notebooks; focus is on pure Python.
- **Notebooks are self-contained**: all code and explanations needed to understand the topic are included in the notebook itself.
- **Progressive learning:** Start with basics, then build on previous concepts in later folders.
- **Portuguese language:** All content, comments, and variable names are in Portuguese.

## Developer Workflows
- **No build or test scripts**: This is an educational resource, not a software package.
- **To add new content:**
  1. Create a new numbered folder in the appropriate section.
  2. Add Jupyter notebooks following the existing naming and structure conventions.
  3. Include explanations, code examples, and at least one exercise per topic.
- **To update content:**
  - Edit the relevant notebook directly. Keep explanations concise and practical.

## Examples
- See `basico/01.Comentario_print_e_Operadores/04.Exercicio.ipynb` for exercise structure.
- See `basico/02.Variaveis/01.Introdu√ßao_Variaveis_e_Tipos.ipynb` for lesson format.

## Integration Points
- No external APIs or services are integrated.
- Optional advanced topics may reference popular libraries (`pandas`, `requests`, `flask`), but these are not required for core content.

## Summary
- **Follow the existing folder and notebook structure.**
- **Keep content in Portuguese.**
- **Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and practical examples.**
- **Exercises are essential for each topic.**
